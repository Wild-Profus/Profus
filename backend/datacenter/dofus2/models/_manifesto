Notes on string field types:
Char is a blank-padded type only there for compatibility with old code and standards.
Varchar is never to be used. Use a Check constraint if a lenght check is required.
Check is much more convenient to change later (without table rewrite),
even more so when views, functions, FK constraints etc. depend on the column type.
ALTER TABLE tbl ADD CONSTRAINT tbl_col_len CHECK (length(col) < 100);
Text is the best character type, with no apparent downside, and as such should be used as often as needed.
